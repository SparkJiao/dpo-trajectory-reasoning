Convert the input texts following the keywords [Context], [Question] and each [Option] into logic forms.  For each logic form, the format is [predicate](entity 1,  ..., entity n). There is a predicate which indicates the relations among at most n entities and those entities are the arguments of the predicate.   
Use logical operations to derive the correct option.  Common logical operators include AND, OR, NOT,   and  ==> (logically implies). 

[Context]:
Jupiter is a gas giant planet and the largest planet in the solar system. Its mass is 2.5 times the total mass of the other seven planets in the solar system. Observations have found that most of the more than 70 moons surrounding Jupiter are composed of water ice. Therefore, Jupiter's atmosphere should contain a considerable amount of water.

[Question]:
Which of the followings, if true, can best support the above statement?

[Options]:
A. After hundreds of millions of years, the satellite may slowly fall onto the planet.
B. Many of the water in interstellar space exists in gaseous form.
C. Uranus is also a gas giant planet, and it has been confirmed that it contains a lot of water ice.
D. The satellite and the planets around it were formed from the same gas and dust at the same time.

----------------------------------------

First, let's create logic forms for the context:

1. Jupiter(isGasGiant, largestInSolarSystem)
2. Jupiter(mass, 2.5*sum(otherSevenPlanets))
3. Moons(jupiter, composedOfWaterIce, >70)
4. Therefore Jupiter(atmosphere, containsConsiderableWater)

Next, let's create logic forms for each option:

A. Satellite(fallOntoPlanet, afterHundredsOfMillionsOfYears)
B. Water(interstellarSpace, existsInGaseousForm)
C. Uranus(isGasGiant, containsLotsOfWaterIce)
D. SatelliteAndPlanets(formedFromSameGasAndDust, atSameTime)

Now, let's analyze each option logically:

A. The fact that a satellite may fall onto a planet in the future doesn't directly support the idea that Jupiter's atmosphere contains water. It doesn't specify if the satellite is made of water ice or not.

B. Even if water in interstellar space exists in a gaseous form, it doesn't directly support the claim about Jupiter's atmosphere.

C. Uranus containing lots of water ice supports the idea that gas giants might have water, but it doesn't link this directly to Jupiter.

D. If the satellite (moons) and the planets (including Jupiter) were formed from the same gas and dust at the same time, and since the moons are composed of water ice, it's logical to infer that Jupiter, being formed from the same materials, would also contain water.

Using the logic forms:

Given that Moons(jupiter, composedOfWaterIce, >70) and SatelliteAndPlanets(formedFromSameGasAndDust, atSameTime), it logically implies that Jupiter should contain water.

Among the given options, Option D: "The satellite and the planets around it were formed from the same gas and dust at the same time" best supports the statement that Jupiter's atmosphere should contain a considerable amount of water.
