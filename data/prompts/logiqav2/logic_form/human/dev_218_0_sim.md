[Context]:
Jupiter is a gas giant planet and the largest planet in the solar system. Its mass is 2.5 times the total mass of the other seven planets in the solar system. Observations have found that most of the more than 70 moons surrounding Jupiter are composed of water ice. Therefore, Jupiter's atmosphere should contain a considerable amount of water.

[Question]:
Which of the followings, if true, can best support the above statement?

[Options]:
A. After hundreds of millions of years, the satellite may slowly fall onto the planet.
B. Many of the water in interstellar space exists in gaseous form.
C. Uranus is also a gas giant planet, and it has been confirmed that it contains a lot of water ice.
D. The satellite and the planets around it were formed from the same gas and dust at the same time.

Here are the logic forms for context, question and options:

[Context]
1. isGasGiant(Jupiter) AND isLargestInSolarSystem(Jupiter)
2. mass(Jupiter) = 2.5 * sumOfMass(otherSevenPlanetsInSolarSystem)
3. composedOfWaterIce(surroundingMoons(Jupiter)) > 70
4. containsConsiderableWater(atmosphere(Jupiter))

[Question]
Which of the followings, if true, can best support the statement Context-4?

[Options]
A. fallOntoPlanet(satellite, planet) AND afterHundredsOfMillionsOfYears()
B. existsInGaseousForm(water, interstellarSpace)
C. isGasGiant(Uranus) AND containsLotsOfWaterIce(Uranus)
D. formedFromSameGasAndDust(satellite, planet) AND atSameTime(satellite, planet)
