Convert the input texts following the keywords [Context], [Question] and each [Option] into logic forms.  For each logic form, the format is [predicate](entity 1,  ..., entity n). There is a predicate which indicates the relations among at most n entities and those entities are the arguments of the predicate.   
Use logical operations to derive the correct option.  Common logical operators include AND, OR, NOT,   and  ==> (logically implies). 

[Context]:
Jupiter is a gas giant planet and the largest planet in the solar system. Its mass is 2.5 times the total mass of the other seven planets in the solar system. Observations have found that most of the more than 70 moons surrounding Jupiter are composed of water ice. Therefore, Jupiter's atmosphere should contain a considerable amount of water.

[Question]:
Which of the followings, if true, can best support the above statement?

[Options]:
A. After hundreds of millions of years, the satellite may slowly fall onto the planet.
B. Many of the water in interstellar space exists in gaseous form.
C. Uranus is also a gas giant planet, and it has been confirmed that it contains a lot of water ice.
D. The satellite and the planets around it were formed from the same gas and dust at the same time.

Here is the transformed ones in logic form:

[Context]
1. isGasGiant(Jupiter) AND isLargestInSolarSystem(Jupiter)
2. mass(Jupiter) = 2.5 * sumOfMass(otherSevenPlanetsInSolarSystem)
3. composedOfWaterIce(surroundingMoons(Jupiter)) > 70
4. containsConsiderableWater(atmosphere(Jupiter))

[Question]
Which of the followings, if true, can best support the statement Context-4?

[Options]
A. fallOntoPlanet(satellite, planet) AND afterHundredsOfMillionsOfYears()
B. existsInGaseousForm(water, interstellarSpace)
C. isGasGiant(Uranus) AND containsLotsOfWaterIce(Uranus)
D. formedFromSameGasAndDust(satellite, planet) AND atSameTime(satellite, planet)

----------------------------------

[Context]
All Anxi people are vegetarians, while all Zhenyuan people are ascetics. Ascetics and vegetarians are like fire and water, and there is no conflict. Guo Shu is an ascetic.

[Question]
Which of the followings can be infered

[Options]
A. Guo Shu is from Zhenyuan.
B. Guo Shu is not from Zhenyuan. 
C. Guo Shu is from Anxi. 
D. Guo Shu is not from Anxi.

Here is the transformed ones in logic form:

----------------------------------

[Context]
1. isVegetarian(AnxiPeople)
2. isAscetic(ZhenyuanPeople)
3. likeFireAndWater(Ascetics, Vegetarians) AND noConflict(Ascetics, Vegetarians)
4. isAscetic(GuoShu)

[Question]
Which of the followings can be inferred?

[Options]
A. fromPlace(GuoShu, Zhenyuan)
B. NOT fromPlace(GuoShu, Zhenyuan)
C. fromPlace(GuoShu, Anxi)
D. NOT fromPlace(GuoShu, Anxi)

----------------------------------

Using the logic forms, let's derive the correct options:

For the first scenario:

From [Context]:
Statement 3 (composedOfWaterIce(surroundingMoons(Jupiter)) > 70) suggests that the moons surrounding Jupiter are mostly composed of water ice. The information that can directly support statement 4 (containsConsiderableWater(atmosphere(Jupiter))) would be related to the connection between the composition of the moons and the atmosphere of Jupiter.

Among the options:

A does not provide any direct relation between the satellite's composition and the planet's atmosphere.
B mentions the gaseous form of water but doesn't link it to Jupiter or its moons.
C only talks about Uranus, not providing a connection between Jupiter's moons and its atmosphere.
D suggests that satellites (moons) and the planet (Jupiter) formed from the same materials. This could imply that since the moons are primarily made of water ice, it's likely that Jupiter's atmosphere would contain water too.

Therefore, the correct option for the first scenario is D.

For the second scenario:

From [Context]:
Statement 1 (isVegetarian(AnxiPeople)) and Statement 2 (isAscetic(ZhenyuanPeople)) differentiate Anxi people from Zhenyuan people based on their practices. Statement 4 tells us Guo Shu is an ascetic.

Among the options:

A. Given the fact that all Zhenyuan people are ascetics, it's possible that Guo Shu is from Zhenyuan, but it's not certain. (It's not stated that ONLY Zhenyuan people are ascetics.)
B. We cannot determine that Guo Shu is NOT from Zhenyuan just based on him being an ascetic.
C. Since no Anxi people are ascetics, Guo Shu cannot be from Anxi.
D. Based on the above explanation, we can confirm that Guo Shu is NOT from Anxi.

Therefore, the correct option for the second scenario is D.
