[Context]
The medieval Arabs had many manuscripts of the ancient Greek. When needed, they translate them into Arabic. Medieval Arab philosophers were very interested in Aristotle's Theory of Poetry, which was obviously not shared by Arab poets, because a poet interested in it must want to read Homer's poems. Aristotle himself often quotes Homer's poems. However, Homer's poems were not translated into Arabic until modern times.

[Question]
Which of the following options, if true, strongly supports the above argument?

[Options]
A. Some medieval Arab translators have manuscripts of Homer poems in ancient Greek.
B. Aristotle's Theory of Poetry is often quoted and commented by modern Arab poets.
C. In Aristotle's Theory of Poetry, most of the content is related to drama, and medieval Arabs also wrote plays and performed them.
D. A series of medieval Arab stories, such as Arab Night, are very similar to some parts of Homer's epic.

Please decompose the problem above into smaller ones so that we can solve it separately and reach the final answer by consideing each subproblem and merge the sub-conclusions.

Alright, let's start by decomposing the main points of the context:

Given Information:
1. Medieval Arabs had ancient Greek manuscripts and translated them when needed.
2. Medieval Arab philosophers were interested in Aristotle's Theory of Poetry.
3. If a poet was interested in Aristotle's Theory of Poetry, they would want to read Homer's poems.
4. Aristotle often quotes Homer.
5. Homer's poems weren't translated into Arabic until modern times.

From this, the primary argument seems to be: Medieval Arab philosophers might have been interested in Aristotle's Theory of Poetry, but Arab poets were not, evidenced by the lack of translated Homer's poems during medieval times (since Aristotle often quotes Homer and a poet interested in the theory would want to read Homer).

Now, let's evaluate the given options in relation to the context:

Subproblems:

1. Does the availability of manuscripts of Homer poems in ancient Greek among medieval Arab translators support the argument?
Option A suggests this. While having the manuscripts might indicate they had access, it doesn't necessarily show a lack of interest from poets. It could mean they simply didn't translate it. However, it subtly supports the argument that even though they had the means to translate Homer's work (having the manuscripts), they chose not to, indicating a lack of interest.

2. Does modern Arab poets quoting Aristotle's Theory of Poetry support the medieval lack of interest in Homer's poems?
Option B suggests this. However, this information is about modern poets and doesn't really provide evidence about the interests or practices of medieval Arab poets.

3. Does the content of Aristotle's Theory of Poetry relating mostly to drama, and medieval Arabs' engagement with plays, support the argument?
Option C suggests this. If Aristotle's theory was mostly about drama and the medieval Arabs engaged with drama, it could hint at a possible interest in Aristotle's Theory. However, it doesn't provide a direct link to their lack of interest in Homer's poems.

4. Are similarities between medieval Arab stories and parts of Homer's epic indicative of Arab poets' interest or lack of interest in Homer?
Option D hints at this. However, similarities in stories don't necessarily indicate direct influence or interest. They could be coincidental or drawn from shared ancient storytelling traditions.

Merging the sub-conclusions:
Among the options, Option A most directly supports the primary argument. The availability of manuscripts, but the lack of translations, gives tangible evidence of the potential for interest, but an actual lack of action on that interest during medieval times.

Final Answer: 
A. Some medieval Arab translators have manuscripts of Homer poems in ancient Greek.
