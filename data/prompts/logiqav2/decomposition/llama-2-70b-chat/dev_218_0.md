Answer the following question.

[Context]:
Jupiter is a gas giant planet and the largest planet in the solar system. Its mass is 2.5 times the total mass of the other seven planets in the solar system. Observations have found that most of the more than 70 moons surrounding Jupiter are composed of water ice. Therefore, Jupiter's atmosphere should contain a considerable amount of water.

[Question]:
Which of the followings, if true, can best support the above statement?

[Options]:
A. After hundreds of millions of years, the satellite may slowly fall onto the planet.
B. Many of the water in interstellar space exists in gaseous form.
C. Uranus is also a gas giant planet, and it has been confirmed that it contains a lot of water ice.
D. The satellite and the planets around it were formed from the same gas and dust at the same time.

Decompose it into smaller questions and answer them first when necessary, and then merge the conclusions to reach the correct answer.

------

1. Can A support the statement?
No, A does not support the statement. The statement only mentions that Jupiter's atmosphere should contain a considerable amount of water, and does not mention anything about the satellite falling onto the planet.
2. Can B support the statement?
No, B does not support the statement. The statement only mentions that Jupiter's moons are composed of water ice, and does not mention anything about the existence of water in interstellar space.
3. Can C support the statement?
Yes, C can support the statement. If Uranus, another gas giant planet, contains a lot of water ice, it suggests that gas giant planets like Jupiter may also contain a lot of water ice. This supports the idea that Jupiter's atmosphere should contain a considerable amount of water.
4. Can D support the statement?
Yes, D can support the statement. If the satellite and the planets around it were formed from the same gas and dust at the same time, it suggests that they may have similar compositions. Therefore, if the moons surrounding Jupiter are composed of water ice, it is reasonable to assume that Jupiter's atmosphere may also contain a considerable amount of water.

Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is:

C and D
