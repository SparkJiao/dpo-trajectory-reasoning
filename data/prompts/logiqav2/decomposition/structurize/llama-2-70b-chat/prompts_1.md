Here are some responses from a dialogue assistant, which are about the plans to solve specific reasoning problems. Please transform them into json structure by the following rules:
1. Each plan can be decomposed in the form of several sub-problems, where each of them is pared with a solution.
2. Some plans are at the same level, which means they are not sub-problems of each other. The same level plans can have an order or not. If they have an order, please follow the order to list them.
3. Some plans are at different levels, which means some are the sub-problems of others.
4. The plans can be saved in a json list, where each item contains exactly three keys: "index", "problem", and "solution".
5. In order to distinguish the different problem level, use the "index" key to indicate the level of the problem. The "index" key is a list of integers, where each integer indicates the index of the sub-problem in the upper level. For example, the "index" key of the first level problem is [0], and the "index" key of the second level problem is [0, 0]. If some the response of some subproblem is expressed by a series sub-problem-solution pairs, then in its own dict, the "response" field can be filled with a particular symbol [DECOMPOSE].
Besides, do not change the original content in the response. Please simply copy them into the structured json.

Let's break down the given passage into smaller parts to better understand the content and identify the main idea:

1. "The reason why the financial crisis has spread to the world is largely because each economy has experienced 6 to 7 years of extraordinary financial expansion, financial innovation and the unprecedented development of financial derivatives during the economic prosperity period."
2. "Under this model, the prices of various assets are constantly being irrationally pushed up."
3. "The key to the governance crisis is to return various assets that have been hyped to high prices to their reasonable price levels."
4. "A period of asset devaluation is inevitable."
5. "This is the debt repayment for the past speeding appreciation."

From the given information, we can identify the main idea of the passage:
The financial crisis has spread globally due to prolonged periods of financial expansion, innovation, and derivative development, leading to irrationally high asset prices. The solution is to return assets to their reasonable price levels through a period of devaluation, which is a form of debt repayment for the past rapid appreciation.

Now, let's evaluate the given options in relation to the main idea:

Subproblems:

1. Does option A accurately summarize the passage?
Option A suggests adopting proactive fiscal policy and appropriately loose monetary policy to stimulate the economy. While stimulating the economy is mentioned in the passage, the focus is on asset devaluation and debt repayment, rather than stimulation alone. Therefore, this option doesn't accurately summarize the passage.

2. Does option B accurately summarize the passage?
Option B suggests stimulating the economy while deflating the bubble. This is closer to the main idea, as the passage does mention the need to return assets to reasonable price levels. However, it doesn't fully capture the focus on debt repayment and the governance crisis.

3. Does option C accurately summarize the passage?
Option C suggests that the goal of a stimulus is to get the economy moving again. While this is mentioned in the passage, it's not the primary focus. The passage is more concerned with addressing the financial crisis and asset prices.

4. Does option D accurately summarize the passage?
Option D suggests maintaining high levels of asset prices through government action or propaganda. This is actually the opposite of the main idea, as the passage advocates for a period of asset devaluation to return prices to reasonable levels.

Merging the sub-conclusions:
Among the options, the closest accurate summary of the passage is:

Final Answer: 
B. Stimulating the economy but also deflating the bubble.

This option captures the dual nature of the proposed solution: stimulating the economy while addressing the asset bubble through devaluation, which aligns with the main idea of the passage.
