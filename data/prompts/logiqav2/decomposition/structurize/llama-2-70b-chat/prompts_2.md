Here are some responses from a dialogue assistant, which are about the plans to solve specific reasoning problems. Please transform them into json structure by the following rules:
1. Each plan can be decomposed in the form of several sub-problems, where each of them is pared with a solution.
2. Some plans are at the same level, which means they are not sub-problems of each other. The same level plans can have an order or not. If they have an order, please follow the order to list them.
3. Some plans are at different levels, which means some are the sub-problems of others.
4. The plans can be saved in a json list, where each item contains exactly three keys: "index", "problem", and "solution".
5. In order to distinguish the different problem level, use the "index" key to indicate the level of the problem. The "index" key is a list of integers, where each integer indicates the index of the sub-problem in the upper level. For example, the "index" key of the first level problem is [0], and the "index" key of the second level problem is [0, 0]. If some the response of some subproblem is expressed by a series sub-problem-solution pairs, then in its own dict, the "response" field can be filled with a particular symbol [DECOMPOSE].
Besides, do not change the original content in the response. Please simply copy them into the structured json.

Let's break down the problem into smaller sub-problems:

1. What information do we need to compare the effects of the two therapies?
2. Which option provides the required information?

Now, let's evaluate the given options:

A. What is the difference between the methods used in the two therapies?
This information might be useful in understanding the reasons behind the difference in effectiveness, but it doesn't directly help in comparing the effects of the two therapies.

B. Is there a big difference in the cost of the two therapies?
Cost is not directly related to the effectiveness of the therapies. This information doesn't help in comparing the effects.

C. What is the proportion of patients with this type of ulcer, treated under traditional therapies in 6 months, who have achieved significant improvement?
This information would help in comparing the effects of the two therapies. If the proportion of patients who achieved significant improvement under traditional therapy is low, it would support the claim that the new therapy is more effective.

D. Among the patients who participated in the 6-month trial of the new therapy, what percentage of the people were dissatisfied with the recovery rate?
This information doesn't directly help in comparing the effects of the two therapies. It might provide insight into the patients' expectations or satisfaction, but it doesn't provide evidence to support or refute the claim that the new therapy is more effective.

Merging the sub-conclusions:
The most relevant information to compare the effects of the two therapies would be the proportion of patients who achieved significant improvement under traditional therapies in 6 months. Option C provides this information.

Final Answer: 
C. What is the proportion of patients with this type of ulcer, treated under traditional therapies in 6 months, who have achieved significant improvement?
