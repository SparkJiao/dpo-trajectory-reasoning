Context:
In a paper published in the Journal of Pediatrics, researchers at a university medical school in the United States pointed out that after a follow-up survey of children from 2,702 families, it was found that if children watched TV for more than two hours a day before the age of 5, their risk of behavioural problems will more than double when they grow up. The so-called behavior problems refer to withdrawn personality, rude words and deeds, aggression against others, difficult to cooperate with others, and so on.

Question:
Which of the following best explains the above argument?

Options:
A. TV programs can make children curious and easily lead to violence.
B. There are a lot of contents in TV programs that can easily make children in a state of tension and fear for a long time.
C. Watching TV for too long will affect the child's interaction with other people, and over time, the child will lack experience in dealing with others.
D. Children have a strong ability to imitate, and if they are only interested in TV programs, in the long run, it will hinder the development of their analytical ability.

Reasoning process:
Thought 1: What is the relationship between watching TV and behavioral problems according to the context?
Action 1: Read the context.
Observation 1: Watching TV for more than two hours a day before the age of 5 increases the risk of behavioral problems.
Thought 2: What might cause the relationship between watching TV and behavioral problems?
Action 2: Consider possible causes.
Observation 2: The cause might be that watching TV for a long time leads to a lack of social interaction, imitation, or exposure to inappropriate content.
Thought 3: Which option best fits the possible causes?
Action 3: Evaluate each option.
Observation 3: Option C might fit the bill, as it suggests that watching TV for too long can limit a child's social interaction, leading to a lack of experience in dealing with others.
Action 4: Finish[The answer is C.]
